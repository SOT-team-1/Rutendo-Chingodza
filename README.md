# UZ WASTE MANAGEMENT

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their  waste disposal points according to their convenience and interaction with the management team.

### To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the  Waste ecosystem.

Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.

#### General Flow

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience,  and transparency at every level. The solution to the existing flawed system is: a waste management website.
The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, the user is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by entering the date and time according to his convenience.
As soon as the waste management team receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the usersâ€™place of consent at the requested date and time. 
On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.
